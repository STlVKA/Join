                    <h2>What is Join?</h2>

                    <p>
                        <span class="accentuated">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as part of their web
                        development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow).
                        <span class="accentuated">Join</span> leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

                                When you log in to <span class="accentuated">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project and contains four
                                default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".

                                In <span class="accentuated">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on "New
                                contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the
                                board.

                                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate
                                list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.

                                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to another.

                                <p>
                                    Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the board.
                                    Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is irreversible.
